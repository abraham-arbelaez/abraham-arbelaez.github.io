I am a fourth-year Statistics student at the Pennsylvania State University. Minoring in Economics and Mathematics. Seeking on continuing my education at a graduate level. Currently doing research in spatio-temporal statistics using Bayesian Methods with [Ephraim Hanks](https://sites.psu.edu/hanks/) (see in [research](/research/)). 

My research interests are:
* Spatio-temporal statistics
* Bayesian statistics
* Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling
