Hello! I am a first-year Ph.D. Student in Statistics at Kansas State University, where I work under the supervision of [Trevor Hefley](https://sites.google.com/view/trevorhefleyresearch/home). I received my B.S. in Statistics from the Pennsylvania State University, where I worked in spatio-temporal statistics using Bayesian Methods with [Ephraim Hanks](https://sites.psu.edu/hanks/) (see in [research](/research/)).

My research interests are:
* Mechanistic Species Distribution Models
* Environmental Statistics
* Spatio-temporal statistics
* Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling
