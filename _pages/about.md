I am a fourth-year Statistics student at the Pennsylvania State University. Minoring in Economics and Mathematics. Seeking on continuing my education at a graduate level. Currently doing research in spatio-temporal statistics using Bayesian Methods under Dr. Ephraim Hanks' mentorship. 

I am interested in Spatio-temporal statistics in the Bayesian framework, and statistical deep learning for Spatial and Spatio-temporal data. I am very excited about the application of those to environmental problems. I am currently working on forecasting the spread of wildfires such as the Thomas and Haypress fires in California.
