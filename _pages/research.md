My research is focused in developing methods with interdisciplinary fields such as Ecology, Entomology, and Agriculture. I am currently working in...

## Mechanistic Species Distribution Models

Species distribution models (SDMs) are like the GPS of ecology, helping us figure out where different animals are likely to hang out based on factors like the weather and what's on the menu. They're super handy for all sorts of things, from figuring out where to put protected areas to planning for how climate change might shake things up for species.


## Animal Movement

Understanding how animals get around tells us a lot about their lives--and a lot about the environment and our planet. I'm really curious about how much of their movement we can capture using statistical models.

In this case, we were able to exhibit how our model captures different trajectories in the case that you saw a bald eagle in Pennsylvania (in blue) compared to seeing a bald eagle in Kansas (in purple).
