My research is focused in developing methods with interdisciplinary fields such as Ecology, Entomology, and Agriculture. I am currently working in...

## Mechanistic Species Distribution Models

Species distribution models (SDMs) are like the GPS of ecology, helping us figure out where different critters are likely to hang out based on factors like the weather and what's on the menu. They're super handy for all sorts of things, from figuring out where to put protected areas to planning for how climate change might shake things up for species.

 
## Animal Movement

Movement behavior tells us much about the ecology of an animal.  I am interested in how much of an animalâ€™s movement can be explained in a mechanistic model linking movement to observable landscape features and biotic drivers.  Such models can provide important information about landscape effects on population connectivity, and potential results of landscape change due to climate change or anthropomorphic disturbances.
