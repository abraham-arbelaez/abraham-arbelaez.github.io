## Archetype Analysis of golden eagle migration patterns using Bayesian Methods

We developed a new approach to archetype analysis, in which covariates are considered, and a subset of the archetypes is defined by existing golden eagles who exhibit known, interpretable behaviors, in order to be fitted using Bayesian methods and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. We were also able to exhibit that covariates such as age influence birdsâ€™ behavior and their migration routes, concluding that the older they get, the more likely they will belong in a non-migratory archetype.
