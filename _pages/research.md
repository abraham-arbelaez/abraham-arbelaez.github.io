My research is focused in developing methods with interdisciplinary fields such as Ecology, Entomology, and Agriculture. I am currently working in...

## Mechanistic Species Distribution Models

Mechanistic Species distribution models (MSDMs) can help us solve the "why" and "how" of [important unanswered ecological questions](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.1999.0534?casa_token=SRE876iPgPUAAAAA:0vbOck1cUnGnWHnkSJPorOsZNxWn5c2_YEwuildWbeLN77qEpmGTsU1chhESaZGSzjrOGf-faGPRX71s)&mdash;don't mind me redirecting you to one of my favorite papers written by May in 1999. MSDMs aim to uncover the "hidden" mechanisms and secondary actors behind what we can catalogue as migration/climate change/extinction of species/etc.




## Animal Movement

Understanding how animals get around tells us a lot about their lives&mdash;and a lot about the environment and our planet. I'm really curious about how much of their movement we can capture using statistical models.

In this case, we were able to exhibit how our model captures different trajectories in the case that you saw a bald eagle in Pennsylvania (in blue) compared to seeing a bald eagle in Kansas (in purple).
