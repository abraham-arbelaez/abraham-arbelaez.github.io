My research is focused in developing methods with interdisciplinary fields such as Ecology, Entomology, and Agriculture. I am currently working in...

## Mechanistic Species Distribution Models

Mechanistic Species distribution models (MSDMs) can help us solve the "why" and "how" of [important unanswered ecological questions](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.1999.0534?casa_token=SRE876iPgPUAAAAA:0vbOck1cUnGnWHnkSJPorOsZNxWn5c2_YEwuildWbeLN77qEpmGTsU1chhESaZGSzjrOGf-faGPRX71s)&mdash;don't mind me redirecting you to one of my favorite papers written by May in 1999. MSDMs aim to uncover the "hidden" mechanisms behind what we see as species migration, species behavior, invasive species, endangered species, etc.

### Ecology

I am currently working with [Dr. Alice Boyle](https://www.aliceboyle.net/) to determine the drivers of population decline of birds, most specifically Grasshopper Sparrow in the midwest.

### Entomology

### Endangered Species

Bumblebees play a crucial role in ecosystems and agriculture as important pollinators. Their pollination services are essential for the production of many fruits, vegetables, and nuts that humans rely on for food. Without bumblebees, crops like tomatoes, blueberries, and almonds would suffer, impacting both food availability and biodiversity. I am working with Danielle Holthaus developing a species distribution model for bombus pennsylvanicus and bombus impatiens&mdash;two species endangered in Kansas.

### Invasive Species

Originally native to Japan, japanese beetles have spread to various parts of North America, where they have become a major conservation problem. They feed on the leaves, flowers, and fruits of over 300 plant species, causing significant damage to agricultural crops, ornamental plants, and natural vegetation. Their voracious appetite and rapid reproduction can devastate landscapes and disrupt ecosystems, leading to declines in plant diversity and overall ecosystem health. I am working with Nicole Kucherov to develop a model that can recreate the species distribution map and prevent the spread of these to protect native plant species and mantain ecosystem balance.

## Animal Movement

Understanding how animals get around tells us a lot about their lives&mdash;and a lot about the environment and our planet. I'm really curious about how much of their movement we can capture using statistical models.

In this case, we were able to exhibit how our model captures different trajectories in the case that you saw a bald eagle in Pennsylvania (in blue) compared to seeing a bald eagle in Kansas (in purple).
